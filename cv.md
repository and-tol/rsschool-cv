3. Summary: My goal is to become a frontend developer. Now I have already mastered the profession of a HTML/CSS coder and  I actively studying JavaScript and React. I used to work as a designer and have a design education. At some point, I decided that I should know what was "under the hood". But after trying to develop sites, I realized-this is mine. It is not a problem for me to understand the design and build a site of average complexity. I have experience working in a small team.
